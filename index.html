      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Samuel Chiazalam Ugbo, a 17-year-old from Abia State,
        Nigeria, currently residing in the vibrant city of Abuja. I am a
        passionate and eager learner with a strong interest in technology and
        engineering. Growing up, I was always fascinated by how things work,
        often taking apart gadgets to understand their inner workings. This
        curiosity, combined with the encouragement of my sister, sparked my
        interest in the tech field. As a recent high school graduate, I am
        excited to begin my journey in backend development, with hopes of
        eventually becoming a full-stack developer. I have always been
        passionate about technology and its potential to change the world.
        Rather than going to college, I decided to dive into the tech field
        early to gain practical experience and skills. Iâ€™m excited to grow my
        skills and contribute to collaborative projects in the field of backend
        development. Joining the ALT School of Engineering is my first step
        toward taking on new challenges and advancing my knowledge. I aspire to
        work on innovative projects that can make a positive impact on society
        and in the World at large, particularly in areas like Gaming, Education,
        Healthcare and Ai technology. In the future, I hope to work with a
        dynamic team at a tech company that values creativity and collaboration.
        I am inspired by figures like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon
        Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Ada Lovelace, who have pushed the boundaries
        of technology and innovation. I believe that with dedication and hard
        work, I can contribute to the tech industry in meaningful ways.
